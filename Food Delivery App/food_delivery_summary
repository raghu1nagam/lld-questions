Here's a comprehensive summary of the food delivery system you've implemented in your Java code:

---

## ‚úÖ **Overview**
This system simulates a **Food Delivery Platform** where:
- Users (Normal/Prime) can register, browse restaurants, place orders, and make payments.
- Restaurants can onboard, add menu items, and receive orders.
- Delivery partners can be onboarded and assigned to deliver orders.
- Notifications are sent throughout the workflow using the **Strategy Design Pattern**.
- Payments are handled via different payment methods using the **Strategy Design Pattern**.

---

## üîß **Design Patterns Used**

### ‚úÖ **Factory Pattern**
- **Why?** To abstract the creation of `User` and `PaymentStrategy` objects based on input types.
- **Used in:**
  - `UserFactory` to create `NormalUser` or `PrimeUser`.
  - `PaymentFactory` to return appropriate `PaymentStrategy` instance.

### ‚úÖ **Strategy Pattern**
- **Why?** To allow dynamic selection of algorithms/behaviors for both **notifications** and **payment processing** without changing the clients.
- **Used in:**
  - `NotificationService` with strategies like `UserNotificationStrategy`, `RestaurantNotificationStrategy`, etc.
  - `PaymentStrategy` interface with `UpiPayment`, `CardPayment`, `CashOnDelivery`.

## üì¶ **Modules Overview**

### 1. **Models**
- `User`: Base class with `NormalUser` and `PrimeUser`.
- `Restaurant`, `MenuItem`: For food providers and their offerings.
- `DeliveryPartner`: Represents a person assigned to deliver.
- `Order`: Represents a placed order and its lifecycle with `OrderStatus`.

### 2. **Services**
- `UserService`: Handles user onboarding and registration logic.
- `RestaurantService`: Manages restaurant onboarding and menu.
- `DeliveryPartnerService`: Registers and assigns delivery partners.
- `OrderService`: Handles placing, accepting, assigning delivery, updating status, and payment.

### 3. **Notifications**
- `NotificationService`: Base class with injected `NotificationStrategy`.
- Separate strategies for User, Restaurant, and DeliveryPartner ‚Äî can easily extend for more.

### 4. **Payments**
- `PaymentStrategy`: Interface to support polymorphic payment execution.
- Concrete implementations for UPI, Card, and COD.
- `PaymentFactory`: Chooses strategy at runtime based on `PaymentType`.

## üßæ **Enums**
Used for cleaner, readable, and maintainable code:
- `UserType` ‚Üí NORMAL, PRIME
- `PaymentType` ‚Üí UPI, CARD, CASH_ON_DELIVERY
- `OrderStatus` ‚Üí PLACED, ACCEPTED, PICKED_UP, DELIVERED

---

## üß† **Advantages of This Design**
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Easily add new strategies (e.g., notification, payment) without modifying existing logic.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service is responsible for its domain (user, restaurant, order).
- **Extensibility:** Add more user types, notification channels (e.g., SMS, email), or delivery partner logic.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic is separate from data representation.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Possible Enhancements**
- Add **availability logic** for delivery partners (currently always picks the first).
- **Error handling** or validations (e.g., null checks on restaurant/menu).
- **Decouple ID generation logic** from models for better control in real systems.
- Implement **menu filtering** or **order history**.
- Integrate **external payment gateway API simulation**.

Let me know if you want to:
- Add real-time availability checking
- Simulate external API integrations
- Add logging instead of `System.out.println`
- Or export this system to a microservice-style architecture in future steps!
